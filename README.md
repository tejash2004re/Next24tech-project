The <head> section contains metadata such as character encoding (UTF-8) and viewport settings for responsive design. It links to Bootstrap CSS for styling and includes a custom stylesheet (style.css). It also includes JavaScript libraries for Bootstrap functionality.

In the <body>, there is a sticky navigation bar created with Bootstrap, featuring links to different sections of the site: Home, Services, Course List, and Contact Us. The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

The main content starts with a large, full-width image followed by an "About Us" section. This section is divided into two columns: one with an image of a woman attending an online class, and the other with text describing the educational services offered, such as skilled instructors, online classes, and international certificates. There is a "Read More" button at the end of this section.

The document also includes commented-out code for a carousel slider, which is not currently active but could be used to display a series of images in a rotating slideshow.

At the end of the <body>, several JavaScript files are included for additional functionality, such as jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap's JavaScript.

Next, there is a "Services" section featuring three service cards. Each card includes an image and a brief description of the service, with links to further details or related pages like the course list and an online bookstore. One card is marked as "Coming Soon."

Finally, the page concludes with a footer containing quick links, contact information (address, email, and phone number), and social media icons. The footer is styled to be visually distinct, with a copyright notice and links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
